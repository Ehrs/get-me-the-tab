# Get Me The Tab

Chrome extension that lets you search, switch to, move, or close tabs across all windows — like a command palette for your browser tabs.

Chrome's built-in tab search (Cmd+Shift+A) can only switch to a tab in its existing window. This extension adds the ability to pull a tab from another window into the current one.

## Install

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this directory
4. (Optional) Rebind the shortcut at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` — default is `Cmd+.` / `Ctrl+.`. Set it to `Cmd+Shift+A` to replace Chrome's built-in tab search with this one.

## Usage

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Switch to the selected tab |
| `⌘Enter` / `Ctrl+Enter` | Move the tab into the current window |
| `⌘X` / `Ctrl+X` | Close the selected tab |
| `Arrow Up/Down` | Navigate the list |
| `Escape` | Close the popup |

Click and `⌘Click` / `Ctrl+Click` also work for switch and move respectively. Each tab row has a close button (×) on hover.
